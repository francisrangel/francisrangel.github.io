Hi there! Welcome to francisrangel.com!

Today I created this blog and I want to share with you how it was. I am still learning how to use Jekyll and checking if the configuration is right. So the next blog post will be about how to set up your website using GoDaddy (domain registration), Github Pages (hosting) and Jekyll (static website generation framework).

Stay tuned!
